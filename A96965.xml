            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>SIR IOHN VVRAYES SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT, <hi>November</hi> the thirteenth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Episcopall Authority, And Lordly Primacy of the Bishops in these our tymes. 1641.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first Challeng for Lordly Primacy, hath of old beene grounded out of the great Charter, by which they hold an Episcopall Primacy or Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to belong to their States of Prelacie, This is their Temporall foundation of maine obiections.</p>
            <p>Here I demand of them unto what Church this great Charter was granted? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157525:3"/> it were not granted to the Church of God in <hi>England;</hi> let the words of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> deside this <hi>Concessimus pro nobis &amp; in perpetuum, quod Ecclesia Anglia Libera. sit habea{que} omnia sua jura Integra, &amp; libertates suas &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by this Charter if it bee rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, there is first proposition made that Honour and Worship should bee yeelded unto God, as truely and indeede belongs to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That not onely such writes and liberties as the King and his progenitors, but also such as God had endued the Church of <hi>England</hi> with, should bee Inviolably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and indeede such onely are to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: indeede such onely are to bee called the Rights and Liberties of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which God himselfe hath given by Law unto the universall Church, and not that which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by their Charter have bequeathed to the particular Church of <hi>England:</hi> And this wee doubt was the cause that moved <hi>Henry</hi> the eight so effectually and powerfully to bend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against the Popes Supremacie usuped at that time over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for (saith the King) wee will hazzard of our life, and losse of our Crowne uphold and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157525:3"/> defend in our Realmes, whatsoever we shall know to be the will of God.</p>
            <p>The Church of God in <hi>England,</hi> not being free, according to the great Charter, but in bondage and servitude of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the love of God. The King Iudged it to stand highly with his Honour, and with his oath to reforme, redresse, and amend the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses of the same See.</p>
            <p>If therefore it might please our gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Lord King CHARLES: that now is in imitation of that his Noble Progenitours to vouchsaf in abolishment of all Lordly supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy executed by Archepiscopall, and Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall authority over his ministers of Christ, his highnesse in so doing, would noe more rightly be charged with the violence of the great Charter, then might <hi>K. H.</hi> 8. With the banishment of Popes supremacy, or then our late Soveraigne Queene <hi>Elizab.</hi> could be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burthened with the breach of her oath, by the establishment of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>Now if the Kings of England (by reason of their Oath) were so straitly tied to the words of the great Charter, that they might not in any sort have disanulled any supposed rights, or liberties of the Church then used and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the said Charter unto the Church, that then was supposed to be the Church of God in <hi>England,</hi> then belike King <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:157525:4"/> eight might be attained to have gone against the great Charter, and against his Oath, when by the overthrow of Abbies and Monasteries, hee tooke away the rights, and liberties of Abbys, and Frierys, for the expresse word of the Charter Abbys and Frierys, had as large and ample a Pattent, for their rights and liberties as Arch-bishops, or Bishops can at this day callenge for their primacy.</p>
            <p>If then the rights, and liberties, of the one as being against the law of God, be duely and lawfully taken away, notwithstanding any matter, clause, or sentence, contained in the great Charter, the other have but litle reason under the Couler of the great Charter to stand upon their pantables, and contend for their Painted sheathes. For this is a Rule and <hi>Maxime</hi> in Gods Lawes, <hi>Quod inomni Iuramen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
